# react-context-toaster

react-context-toater is a **React** component used to display nice [**toast notifications**](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/12000). It does so by wrapping an outer component with a `<ContextToaster>` component and adding notifications with a methods that passed down with [**context**](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html).
react-context-toaster:

  - Allows easy, global toasts without thinking too much about it :)
  - Offers pretty, customizable design that follows [material design](https://material.io/) principles.
  - offers highly customizable toasts.
  - Can show text or HTML content.
  - Can display multiple stacked notes.

This is a **work in progress** and is by no means stable or finished. Expect more changes, customization and feature.
